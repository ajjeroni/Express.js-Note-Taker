# Express.js-Note-Taker

## Description

For this task, students had to implement their knowledge of Express.Js to connect the front-end starter code of a note taking application with the back-end code that must be created by the student. 

## Usage

In the application, you can press "get started" and it will direct you to the note taking page. 

Once in the note taking page, you can write a note with a title and a text, then you could proceed by pressing the save button in the top right.

You can access your note by clicking on it in the left hand column, this will let your note appear in the right hand column. 

You can create a new note by pressing the plus button in the top right or press the "note taker" text in the top left and it will redirect you to the start page of the application.
